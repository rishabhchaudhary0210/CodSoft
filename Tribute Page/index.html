        <h2>About</h2>
        <div>

            <p>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, fondly known as the "People's President," was a remarkable Indian scientist and
                politician who left an indelible mark on the nation's scientific and political landscape. He was born on
                October 15, 1931, in the small town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. From humble beginnings, Dr. Kalam
                went
                on to become one of the most revered figures in Indian history.</p>
        </div>

            <div>

                <p>Dr. Kalam's journey began with a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of
                    Technology, after which he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). His brilliance and
                    dedication were soon evident, and he played a pivotal role in India's first indigenous Satellite
                    Launch
                    Vehicle (SLV) program. This achievement marked the beginning of his illustrious career in space
                    research
                    and technology.</p>
                <p>One of his most significant contributions was to India's defense technology. Dr. Kalam was the
                    driving
                    force behind the development of India's first indigenous ballistic missile, the Agni, which
                    catapulted
                    India into an elite group of nations with intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities. His
                    leadership in the development of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP) earned
                    him
                    the title of the "Missile Man of India."</p>

        <div>

            <p>Besides his scientific prowess, Dr. Kalam was a visionary educator. He recognized the importance of
                nurturing young minds and inspiring them to pursue science and technology. Throughout his life, he
                interacted with countless students, encouraging them to dream big and work hard. His autobiography,
                "Wings of Fire," became a source of inspiration for millions of young Indians.</p>

            <div>

                <p>Dr. Kalam's contributions extended beyond the realms of science and technology. In 2002, he took on
                    the
                    role of the President of India, serving a five-year term. During his tenure, he continued to
                    advocate
                    for education and innovation, often visiting schools and colleges to connect with the youth. His
                    presidency was marked by his simplicity, humility, and unwavering commitment to the welfare of the
                    people.</p>

                <p>Even after his presidential term, Dr. Kalam remained an active participant in India's educational and
                    scientific endeavors. He received numerous awards and honors, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
                    highest civilian award. His dedication to the nation and his vision for a self-reliant India in
                    science
                    and technology continue to inspire generations.</p>

            <p>Tragically, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam passed away on July 27, 2015, while doing what he loved the most -
                interacting with students.While delivering a
                lecture at the Indian Institute of
                Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and
                died from an apparent cardiac arrest at the age of 83 years. His legacy lives on, not only in the numerous achievements and milestones he
                accomplished but also in the hearts of millions who continue to be inspired by his life, values, and
                teachings.</p>
